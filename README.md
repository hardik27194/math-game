# Math Game
### Synopsis

Math Game is a very simple app that that allows users to create accounts and play either a 10 question addition game or a 10 question subtraction game. The app keeps track of user points.

### Motivation
I decided to build this app to help teach young kids addition and subtraction. I thought it would be more fun for them to practice math with colorful objects on an iOS device then it would be to use a pencil and paper. As a new iOS developer, I also wanted to gain more experience building apps.

### Installation
Feel free to to download the app and run a build with xcode.
